# Sudoku Solver
This project consists of a Python Interface that Solves Sudokus

You can:
 - Play sudoku normally
 - Enter a sudoku you're struggling with and solve it
 - Solve one of our pre-existing sudoku grids
 
The sudoku solver has two buttons to solve the sudoku, with the second button solving the sudoku with less iterations.
